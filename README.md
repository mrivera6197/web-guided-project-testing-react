## Setup
Steps to be ready for the GP today:
1. clone the repo to your machine (no need to fork, unless you want to)
2. cd to project
3. run npm install (all dependencies we need to start are there, so no need to add new dependencies)
4. run npm start to fire up project in the browser
5. Open the project in your editor
